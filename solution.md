react-create-app was used for this solution.
In an actual app, if there's no incentive to use react-create-app, a manual harness could be set up, or react-create-app ejected.
My other repository could be viewed to see an example of such a manual harness: https://github.com/AKaudinov/ReactReduxStarterKit
